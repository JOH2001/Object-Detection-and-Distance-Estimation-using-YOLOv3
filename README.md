# Object-Detection-and-Distance-Estimation-using-YOLOv3

This program uses a pretained YOLOv3 neural network with COCO and estimates the distance to the object detected in the picture.

For this to work you will need to know the size of your object in millimetres as well as the focal length and sensor height of your camera.

The camera used in this example is from an iPhone 12.
